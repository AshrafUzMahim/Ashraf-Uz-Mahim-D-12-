            World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of
            the globe. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster
            international co-operation and prevent future conflicts,[1] with the
            victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United
            Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the permanent members of its
            Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as
            rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly
            half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the
            influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation
            of Africa and Asia.

            half-century-long Cold War. Most countries whose industries had been
            damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and
            economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to
            forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense
            of common identity.
